          <h2>Causes of the Problem</h2>
          <p>Scientists attribute the cause of Climate Change mainly as Global Warming, and further more it is caused by Green House effect which means  warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.</p>
          <img class= "cause1" src="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/review/greenhouse-effect/greenhouse-effect-diagram.jpg">
          <p>Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Gases, such as water vapor, which respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature which increases the temperature. <br><br> Some of these gases are as follows: 
          <ul>
            <li>Water Vapour</li>
            <li>Carbon dioxide</li>
            <li>Methane</li>
            <li>Nitrous oxide</li>
            <li>Chlorofluorocarbons</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>On Earth, human activities are changing the natural greenhouse. Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.</p>

          <p>The industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from 280 parts per million to 416 parts per million in the last 150 years. The panel also concluded there's a better than 95 percent probability that human-produced greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have caused much of the observed increase in Earth's temperatures over the past 50 years.</p>
