          <h2>Dangerous Effects</h2>
          <p>Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner. Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come, largely due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities. </p>

          <p>According to the IPCC(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), the extent of climate change effects on individual regions will vary over time and with the ability of different societal and environmental systems to mitigate or adapt to change. Some of these effects include:
            <ul>
              <li>More Droughts and Heat Waves: Droughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) everywhere are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense everywhere.</li>
              <li>Hurricanes Will Become Stronger and More Intense: Hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates are projected to increase as the climate continues to warm.</li>

              <li>Sea Level Will Rise 1-8 feet by 2100: Due to The intense heat the ice caps at polars will melt and it is projected to rise another 1 to 8 feet by 2100.</li>
              <li>Changes in Precipitation Patterns: This trend is projected to occur even in regions where total precipitation is expected to decrease.</li>
