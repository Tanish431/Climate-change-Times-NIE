          <p>Hello, this is a site made for spreading awarness about an undiscussed dangerous problem which would affect all of us irrespective of any bias, i.e., Global Warming And Climate Change. We all may have listened these terms in protests and in social media but have never gone in depth with the topic. Consciously or unconsciously, we are doing a permanent damage on this environment in which we live in yet no one ever signfies it. I hope that I may help you and the environment both at the same time with this information.</p>

          <p>Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth's local, regional and global climates.  These include warming temperatures and changes in precipitation, as well as the effects of Earth's warming, such as Rising sea levels.</p>

          <p class= "gwp1">Global warming, the gradual heating of Earth's surface, oceans and atmosphere, is caused by human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels that pump carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p>
